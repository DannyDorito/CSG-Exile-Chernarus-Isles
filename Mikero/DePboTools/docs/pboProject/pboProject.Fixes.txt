1.72:
fixed unpleasant bug if binarise crashes where pbo project might too!

1.71
restored persistency to rebuild cfgPatches
fixed bug introduced in 1.70 where cmdline would often not return bad status

1.70
	renamed rebuildreqaddins in setup and documentation to rebuild cfgPatches to be less confusing

1.69
	stopped crash when bad syntax on command line
	added +-R  rebuild reqaddons
	now fails if a texheader should have been created and hasn't been
1.68
	wrp
		full build is forced if any unbinarised p3d's are repacked in same session.
		automatically (re)builds pbos which a wrp uses and they have been detected as stale or not present in temp
1.67	free tools release
1.66
	wrp builds only
		checks p3d's in temp are, in fact, binarised
		checks binarised p3d is a later filedate than the source

changed initial default startup engine from arrowhead to arma3
tested for a blank source folder for joblists. can only happen as a result ofg changing work drives
added personal copy of dsCreateKey.exe for those installs of arma2 which don't have it or can't be found

1.61: improved rapify support
1.60
	improved utf8 filename builds
	now stops if binarise crashes

wrp

1.59
	reworded to gui to "sign pbo(s)"
	reworded rtm skeleton usage

1.58
changed titlebar to nameof folder being crunched to assist with selecting one, of multiple instances
of pboProject

forced extern references for where legacy versions *might* have it unset in registry

logged command line for makepbo

1.57
subscriber version of 1.56 with all features enabled
1.56
revised mod.cpp
reverted source saving to p:(dot) source
1.55
removed striplog as an option. it's now permanently set but actually irrelevent for a3 builds

restored the moving of source folders back to p:\\(dot)source. read the readme

1.54
minor fix to speed up checking of roadslib cfg
fixed texheaders.bin generation if a spaced path argument
blocked appid being set unless a3 dlc is being produced

a source folder is ignored for all processing, BUT, only one source folder can exist per pbo to be made, each one joblist

source folder now also hidden from view during generation of texheaders.bin

fixed error in checking model.cfg for skeleton names

1.52
better wording if a (dot)source folder is detected and what to do about it after a crash

correction to the method by which exlcudes are excludes (internal)
too many terrain builder files were appearing in temp. my bad

1.41
small improvements to potential ctd's before the gui can initialise

improved cli (dos prompt) for bat processing. 


1.40
now accounts for binarised odol p3d's that it cannot decode (version unknown) by ignoring them for file checking purposes
added a timestamp to ending message so that multiple instances can be checked for when last one was completed

1.39
crippled check extern button so that it's permanently forced on. This because ppl were abusing it's use and stating pboProject reported no errors (because they disabled it)

1.38 made compat to dll
1.37
added a jobs completed msg to dos screen when building multiple pbo's to avoid confusion whether processing has finished or not
p3d: now checks integrity of p3d's before further processing

1.36
corrected command line version to reflect the proper <workspace>\temp folder NOT the <mod> folder
added (optional) no file datestamps to ensure successive builds of same pbo result in same sha

1.35 
multiple pbo crunching:
	delayed wrp creation(s) until all other PBO types (if any) are made. 
	this because p3d's it might be using need to be packed first

added a Keys folder to the mod folder and copied the public key used to sign the pbo's

1.33 fix to 1.32 when creating temp folders

1.32
