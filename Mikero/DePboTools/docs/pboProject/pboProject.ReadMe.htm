<p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>What is pboProject?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>pboProject </b>is binPbo/Addont Builder on steroids. It has been in 
existence for some years as the tool behind cwr2. A <b>mod</b> that packs dozens of pbos 
for distribution in a single operation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">pboProject is not just a 'makepbo'. it creates MODS. 
(which include addons, missions, and campaigns). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">pboProject is designed for multi engine packing from ofp 
thru to vbs and the Arma series.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">pboProject allows you to build one, or dozens of pbos in 
one go. (A 'pbo' is an .xbo, .ebo, .ifa, or .pbo, dependent on 
engine type selected)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The basic philosophy is:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">P:/MyProject<br>
P:/MyProject/MyObjects<br>
P:/MyProject/MyObjects/MyPlants<br>
P:/MyProject/MyObjects/MyBuildings<br>
P:/MyProject/MyObjects/MyRoads<br>
P:/MyProject/MyObjects/MyIsland<br>
P:/MyProject/MyMissions<br>
P:/MyProject/MyMissions/MissionOne<br>
P:/MyProject/MyMissions/MissionTwo<br>
P:/MyProject/MyMissions/MyCampaign</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">For your interest, this <b>is</b> the topology used by BIS 
with their chained model.cfgs. Advanced model makers will already be using this 
architecture and they <b>now</b> have a packer they can use.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">For your interest, this <b>is</b> the method of providing 
patch pbos. So called hotpatch. One huge pbo later followed by smaller ones only containing a child 
folder or three.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Selecting any one of the above 'Source Folders' will 
generate one, or, multiple pbos determined by the content of that source folder 
and it's children (if any)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Selecting:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">P:/MyProject -&gt; (re)builds everything</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">P:/MyProject/MyMissions-&gt; (re)builds all the missions 
  only</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">P:/MyProject/MyObjects/MyPlants-&gt;(re) builds a single 
  'plants' pbo</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">There is no restriction in depth. MyPlants, could be 
  separated into (at least) two other pbos MyPlants,/MyBushes, and MyPlants/MyTrees</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">For simple use, clearly, if there are no child folders 
  <u>of consequence</u> in MyProject, then only MyProject.pbo is built.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><u>Folders of consequence</u>: The presence of a config.cpp/bin, 
mission.sqm. or desc.ext (for campaign) marks the beginning of a pbo for <b>that</b> 
folder and all it's children (if any). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note that any subsequent configs in child folders are NOT 
pbo's in their own right. They become part of the classic, 'multiple addons 
within a single pbo'. This is the method by which you initially release one big 
pbo, and for subsequent patches to plants (eg) you merely repack plants!!!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The other major features of pboProject are:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Exhaustive file reference checking in any file 
  containing them. (configs, bisurfs, rvmats, 
  wrps and p3d's etc)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Ability to have any mix of pre-binarised/pre-rapped AND 
  plain Jane files in the source folder.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Binary animations other than ofp2_manskeleton</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">No requirement to have a copy of ca\ (or any other 'addon') in
  <b>your_projects</b> folder</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">No requirement to have p3d helper p3d's to pack 
  textures that are only 
  referenced by configs (icons eg)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Absolute certainty that a mixture of all texture types 
  (tga,png, pac, pax) produce the very latest paa file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">strips the log file of irrelevant messages making it 
  readable again for locating problems with your p3d</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The full power of dePbo.dll including compression, and all the other good 
  stuff hidden away and transparent to the user.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Automatic delivery of the target pbo(s) into the 
  correct location of an @mod folder</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Automatic detection of the typeof pbos required. Any 
  mix of addon, mission, and campaign pbos.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Automatic signing of pbo's and distribution of the 
  public key</font></li>
</ul>

<p><b><font face="Arial">The most 
forbidding of all errors is your addon works, but unknown to you at the time, destroys others. The dll wont let you. Expect to be frustrated and thank me later.</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The dll is quite likely to give you a specific reason for 
the bad result, and it expects you to fix it. 'Errors' range from simple typos 
to known, under-the-covers issues with different engines that break if you 
create a p3d with no geolod (exaggerated&nbsp; licence used). or an ofp config 
intended for arma.</font></p>

<p><u><b><font face="Arial">Bis tool sets:</font></b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>pboProject </b>autodetects the location of bi's, and 
other, mikero tools. It utilises pal2pace, dssSignFile, and binarize.exe 
and (dsCreateKey if discovered).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">pboProject distinguishes the difference in tools between 
Arrowhead 2.5.1 and Steam. Both are accommodated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Only modest support is currently provided for ofp, 
  vbslite and ifa. Your mileage will vary for these engines.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">pboProject only uses bis binarise.exe for <b>UN</b>binarised p3'ds, wrps and rtm. All other file 
types 
are handled by the dll.</span></font></p>
<p><u><b><font face="Arial">Pbo Types:</font></b></u></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">pboProject distinguishes between:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Addons (any folder containing a config.cpp/bin)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Missions (any folder containing a mission.sqm <b>and 
    no config)</b></font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Campaigns (any folder containing a desc.ext <b>and no

    <li><font face="Arial">pbos with/without prefixes</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">pbos sent to different parts of the mod folder</font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><u><b><font face="Arial">Internal packing characteristics</font></b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>All</b> relevant bi files are transparently checked 
  and packed.&nbsp; All non relevant files are not packed. There is no need to specify 
  exclude, or include lists.</font></li>
  <li><b><font face="Arial">All</font></b><font face="Arial"> relevant files are 
  binarised (or rapified if they can be rapified). Examples are config.cpp, rvmats, bisurfs, texheander.bin, wrp, p3d.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The packer analyses specific file types for errors. 
  Typo's in mission.sqms, bad references in p3ds, missing classes in configs.....</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">tga pax and png files are checked for staleness. Unlike 
  binPbo it is an almost-certainty that the correct filedate is worked with. 
  Picture files intended only for configs or missions are fully accounted for.</font></li>

<p><font face="Arial">There are variations on this simple folder topology based mostly on 
your own creativity and imagination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Note that configs within configs are not deemed to be 
pbo's in their own right. It is a reasonably common practice to have multiple 
addons (configs) in the same pbo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can view the output with mild interest to see whether specific files are 
being compressed eg, or rapified eg, or simply being excluded. At the end of the

the last message on the console and an accompanying messageBox to warn you of 
the failure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">bis binarize.exe has never been fixed by 
Bis to return anything except good status.&nbsp; As a result, the packer can only assume everything is ok. 
Fortunately, binarize does show a halt gui to warn you. (but is of no use for a

<p><font face="Arial">As a convenience, individually processed pbo's can be

display the folder of logs instead</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><u><font face="Arial">Options</font></u></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">Should only be used when you strike trouble to 
locate <b>the</b>, offending error via <b>View Output. </b>It should not be used 
for normal packing. The output content is enormous and consequently ties up a 
lot of processing time.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Strip log: </font></b></p>

  <blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">Since arrowhead, bi broke a great deal of binarize.exe and 
it produces erroneous class conflicts and missing stringtables. This because 
binarize no longer respects the cfgpatches class for load order. Perhaps a 
necessary evil to speed processing up since it's only scanning for land classes, 
each one of which is unique.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In additon, bis binarize produces a great deal of 
(unimportant) st warnings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The end result is that the .log is too noisy to find REAL 
errors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">striplog removes this noise.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Striplog.bat: </font></b></p>

    <blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">StripLog.bat is installed in mikero's pbotools folder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can tailor it to suit your needs by adding / removing 
phrases that you don't/ do want appearing in the log. As suppled, it removes 99% 
of noise.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Sign Pbos:</font></b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">the pbo is signed after transfer to the mod folder.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Full Build</font></b></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">Identical in intent to binPbo's clean temp. Essentially an 'all bets 
are off, rebuild everything' check box. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Unlike binpbo some files are <b>always </b>rebuilt<b>.&nbsp;
</b>You can safely do a full build, once, using this packer. And, faster-rebuild 
steps for subsequent alterations. The packer is very aware of all nuances of tga 
/ png files and the need to include them even when they aren't used by a p3d or 
wrp. It is very sensitive to changes of source files that binpbo ignores.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Compress:</b><font face="Arial"><b>see the MakePbo readme</b></font></p>

<p>will compress specific file types in a pbo depending on context of the pbo (mission,addon,engine 
type). Up to 50% reduction for map addons, 80% for missions and 10...30% for&nbsp; 
standard p3d addons. </p>

bis binarise getting oh-so-confused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note that unlike bis tools, pboProject does not allow you

being so is that <b>ALL</b> projects, even the ones you made last year <b>MUST</b> 
point to the one common temp. In the bis dev world (not your world) the temp 
folder<b> is</b> the game engine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The gui warns you that deleting everything out of here, 
while beneficial, is a drastic step. No harm will come to your pc in doing so, 
but caveat emptor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><u>Delete all mod files</u> <font color="#FF0000">drastic</font></font></p>
<p>A last chance warning message is provided.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">set by default. This correctly records the date 
stamp of every file packed into the pbo. There might be occasions where this 
behaviour is undesirable. Such as two people building the same pbo with 
identical files but different date stamps on their pc, or, an innocent edit of a 
text file that, in fact, didn't change anything of substance (but being saved 
again, it's date stamp changed). Use with caution, because you are violating the 
standard extraction mechanisms. The files extracted will have been created on 
1st January 1970. Caveat emptor.</font></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b><font face="Arial">Rebuild cfgPatches:</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">cfgPatches </font></b>is used for two purposes.</p>

<p>1) to declare which addon extern classes come from</p>

<p>2) to ensure external file references actually have that addon loaded.</p>

<p>The dll will rebuild required addons, based on foreign references it 
discovers in your configs. eg files, that are not within this pbo.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, badly constructed addons, can have circular references.</p>

<p>addon A wants a texture from addon B<br>
addon B wants an rvmat from addon A</p>

<p>both, in theory, need to be loaded at same time to operate correctly.</p>

<p>This feature is optional, where re-construction of your addons are too

<p><font face="Arial">To future proof pboproject (and indeed makepbo and the dll) 
a default list of file exclusions is provided in setup.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In brief this option came about because of the increasing 
use by Bis of hpp files to be included in a config.cpp, and, the need to account 
for new file types (such as roadlibs.cfg and any more newly introduced files as 
bis improve the product)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Normally hpp files have no meaning outside of a config.bin. 
An unfortunate exception to this has occurred with community use of hpp to 
contain sqX statements. (In hindsight the&nbsp; file(s) should have been called 
sqH).</font></p>

simply remove hpp in the setup panel.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial">Note that the exclude list applies to ALL pbo's packed

compressing files in a pbo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Ordinarily you should let the dll determine what is 
appropriate (it has far greater knowledge than you of the various engine and pbo 
types)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The default list is more a case of not bothering to try 
and compress, already compressed, file types such as paa, jpg and sounds. This 
speeds the process of building a pbo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Special circumstances currently exist for paX files, they 
should not be compressed for addons, while use in missions is 'ok'.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Similarly, sqX files might encounter issues if compressed 
in missions. The dll will never compress init.sqs and init.sqf, no matter what.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This facility is provided solely for your experimentation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">By default, PboProject will automatically discover the needed path settings. 
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The following section applies if you prefer to hand-tweak and over-ride pboProject's scanner.</span></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">&lt;workspace&gt;\any\where\paths-to-configs;more\configs;more\configs;</font></b></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The packer <b>only</b>

increases throughput.</span></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The packer ignores Source\*.*</font></li>
  <li><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><font face="Arial">There is no 
requirement to copy configs into your project area (which was, frankly, 
ridiculous).</font></span></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>When creating island wrps,</b> bis binarize needs to locate 
the land_p3d class for each p3d encountered in the wrp (if any). This to enable 
animations (such as doors) to happen IN an island. (identical editor placed 
objects ON and island behave differently).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Binarize locates the land_p3d class by scanning configs. It is your responsibility to provide (a series of) 
extracted addons that contain configs that contain p3d references for objects 
<b>you</b> use on <b>your</b> island.&nbsp; Hardly a difficult task, since in 
order to add objects to islands you've already extracted those folders!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">pboProject simply synchronises the &quot;workspace&quot; you're already 
using in an understandable manner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The config can be a config.bin or a config.cpp</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The default addon is <b>workspace</b>\ca which, by inference contains <b>
all</b> addons in the official bis pbos. Much the same could be said for <b>
workspace</b>\a3 
if you are building islands for Arma3. Neither are relevant to <b>your</b> island if none of 
your island objects derive from ca (or a3) p3d's !!!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">What <b>will</b> be relevant is a comma separated list of paths to 
all addon(s) used on <b>your</b> island.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">EG: If you're using some 
<span style="background-color: #00FF00">custom buildings </span>on your terrain, 
and they, <b>and their config,</b> are located in <b>workspace\MyTag\CustomStuff</b>, 
then you'd ADD that folder to the &quot;Addon Folder(s)&quot; list simply by clicking the 
Addon Folder(s) button and navigating to the required location.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This will ensure your 
<span style="background-color: #00FF00">custom building classes</span> are located 
and any animations, etc your buildings may have will be properly implemented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can add as many 'addons' as required. Note that the 
more precise the list, the less time is spent by binarize.exe in scanning.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Arma3 Island Builds.</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To build Arma3 island builds successfully, and to get 
round the infamous no-icon error, bis binarise.exe requires that <b>ALL</b> 
p3'ds used on your island are:</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">binarised</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">located in the temp folder</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial">This has nothing to do with the base requirement that <b>
ALL</b> p3d's are&nbsp; in their correct locations in <b>workspace</b>. 
Duplicates of those files must also, be in the temp folder.<b> Do not blame me!</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">pboProject scans the temp folder to ensure that this is 
the case and tries to avoid having severe bloat in the temp folder of duplicated 
and un-necessary copies of the same p3d if you aren't using them.</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">whether binarised or not, the p3d must exist in the 
  &lt;engine space&gt;. If not, do something about it.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>un</b>binarised models used on your islands are 
  inspected for staleness. If they are later file dates than the binarised 
  equivalents found in temp,&nbsp; (or they aren't found in temp!) pboProject 
  insists that you (re) build them first.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">any binarised objects, such as those derived from arma3 
  itself, or any other extracted addon, and even those you have pre-binarised in 
  your project folder,&nbsp; are silently copied to temp in the correct 
  location. A file date check is used to ensure you are using the latest copy.</font></li>

<p><b><font face="Arial">MOD.CPP</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">mod.cpp is a file placed directly in the root of your

cause of the problem and it's location in a file is pretty verbose.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>technical notes</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">the packer is hard-wired to use <b>workspace</b>\temp to store files for 
bis binarise</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The 'temp' folder behaves in identical manner to binPbo. 
It is a place to store intermediate files for packing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The temp folder is 
only used if bis binarize.exe is invoked and pboProject tries to avoid doing so.</span></font></p>

<p><u><b>Source Folders:</b></u></p>

<p>pboProject will force bis binarise to ignore a source folder in the current 
pbo being built.</p>

<p>It does so by temporarily moving that folder to p:/(dot)source</p>

<p>For this mechanism to work, only one source folder can exist per pbo. Note 
this distinction, only one source folder, regardless of the amount of addons in 
that pbo.</p>

<p>When building multiple pbo's you can of course have source folders in each 
one of them.</p>

<p>As a protection mechanism, if a p:/(dot)source folder already exists 
pboProject will not continue until you do something about it.</p>

<p>This 'protection' is there in the unlikely event that pboProject was unable 
to move the folder back to it's original location.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="5"><b>Using $PBOPREFIX$.txt : Optional</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bis have made increasing use of var=something in the 
header of pbo's to expand the meaning of that pbo. These strings are called 
token pairs. (bis binarize calls them -properties)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Such examples are</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">prefix=my\folder\some\where</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">product=ifa&nbsp; // a pbo intended only for ifa engines</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">product=a3 // ditto</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">svn= 1567 //&nbsp; a vbs2lite encryption key</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">version=21;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">author=somebody</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">These token pairs are as numerous (and as long) as a piece 
of string. There is no limit to their quantity. Anything not understood / not 
looked for, in the header is ignored by the various engines. Most token pairs 
even if understood are optional (even prefix=)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">$PBOPREFIX$.txt<b> if present</b> in the same folder as 
the root config.cpp (eg the root folder of the intended pbo) is examined for 
token pairs</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">such pairs are inserted into the header of the pbo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This mechanism works via the dll and is unconditional. It 
is not dependent on bis binarize or any other tool.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;If you place (or leave after extraction) a 
prefix.txt in the folder, it's contents will be reflected into the new pbo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Thus, if you were making a pbo intended solely for arma3, 
you would state</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">product=a3</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">you could just as easily state</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Author= I am famous</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">It is quite legal to have multiple $prefixes$ in child 
subfolders (with attendant configs). They are ignored.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">They are used at the time you choose to issue only a pbo 
of that subfolder. It is the subject of pbo patching and outside the scope of 
this document.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><b><font face="Arial">Historical $PBOPREFIX$</font></b></u></p>

<p><font face="Arial">$PBOPREFIX$.txt is an alias for any of the following file 
names</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">$PBOPREFIX$</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">$PBOPREFIX$.txt</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">pboPrefix.txt</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">The reasons for the different names are a progression from 
the early dayz of xbox elite to the present time. The dll recognises any of them 
as being valid.</font></p>

<p><u><b><font face="Arial" size="5">Rtm Skeletons</font></b></u></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>All</b> animation.rtm's can be binarised (for engines 
arrowhead and beyond). BinPbo can only binarise ofp2_manskeleton. This packer 
does better.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">pboPacker examines the rtm for the 'correct' skeleton to 
use. By default, this is <b>ofp2_manskeleton</b>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">For all other skeletons pboPacker reads the model.cfg of
<b>this</b> pbo and uses the last (or only) class cfgskeletons entry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">example:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">//model.cfg in <b>this</b> pbo folder</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">class CfgSkeletons<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; class Default;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp; .........</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><br>
&nbsp;class <span style="background-color: #00FF00">BridgeSkel</span> : Default<br>
&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; skeletonInherit = &quot;Default&quot;;<br>
&nbsp; skeletonBones[] =<br>
&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;1&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&nbsp; //components that will animate on 
destruction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;2&quot;,&quot;&quot;,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;3&quot;,&quot;&quot;,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;4&quot;,&quot;&quot;<br>
&nbsp; };<br>
&nbsp;};<br>
};</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">For whatever reason the packer cannot binarise the rtm, there is 
no ill effect, the rtm simply appears in the pbo as a plain jane.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">For this mechanism to work&nbsp; the following rules 
apply:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Only rtms containing a common skeleton can be binarised in 
  <b>this</b> pbo. You can have any number of p3ds and any nubner of skeleton 
  classes pertaining to those p3d's in the model.cfg for this pbo, but the <b>last</b> 
  skeleton class must pertain to this pbo's collection of rtms (and potentially 
  p3d's as well)..</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The first model.cfg encountered in a reverse traverse 
  is the model.cfg used by pboProject to binarise rtm's</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">A reverse traverse occurs in identical manner to bis. 
  There need not be a model.cfg in the pbo folder, but one just behind it, or 
  just behind that, and etc.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Reading the above rules, it should be obvious that you 
can't have soldier.p3d's and bridge.p3d's in the same pbo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As a general rule, there is no issue here, since, in 
general, a pbo contains nothing but one or several variations of the same tank, 
bridge, building or spotted giraffe.</font></p>
